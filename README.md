GitBifröst
==========

Built for game developers who are used to the world of versioned game data, GitBifröst bridges the worlds of git and large binaries.

### Requirements ###
1. Allow users to version large binaries easily with along side source code
2. Binary handling must be transparent to non-power users and other tools so that anyone and anything that uses git doesn't require knowlege of GitBifröst
3. Allow git power users to work locally in all their normal distributed git glory
